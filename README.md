MoatFund Smart Contract Protocol

#1) Moat Token
This smart contract keeps the immutable record of all the MoatCoin holders and their balances. MTC shows your Proof Of Membership (POM) of the MoatFund.
It’s an ERC20 standard token, having a symbol MTC with no decimals. So like Ethereum and Bitcoin, you can’t trade MoatCoins in decimals (0.92663). It need to be executed in full numbers ( like 1 or 7 or 165). No decimals.

#2) Moat Fund
Our team has power to Mint MoatCoins to any extent but we can’t retain the coins. After minting, the coins get transferred to MoatFund smart contract immediately and can only be retained by sending Ethereum to the address. It’s unilateral and reducing the reckless minting of coins by smart contract owners.
It’s the most important and valuable smart contract in MoatCoin ecosystem. It has:
Ethereum sent by Investors.
MoatCoin available for sale.
Alt coins (which represents the portfolio).

Anytime and anywhere you can check the portfolio, total assets, net worth etc. on MoatFund Smart Contract. Complete transparency.

#3) Moat Board
This contract restricts the usage of Ethereum by team. Team can move the Ethereum from MoatFund to MoatBoard smart contract and execute a new proposal. Only board members can create a proposal.
Members will vote and if the votes are:
Above 50%, then ethereum will be transferred to team address.
Below 50%, then the ethereum will be again transferred to MoatFund Smart Contract.

The contract will maintain the record of all the proposals and votes for future reference.

To take funds out of contract, the proposal needs to be voted true by board members.

#2) Team Address.
This is the address which will show how much exposure the team have in MoatFund Protocol. It will hold all the MoatUnits and Ethereum which are owned by team to ensure that we have enough exposure in the Moatfund.
